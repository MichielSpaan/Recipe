INSTRUCTIONS
 
Method;
Preheat oven to 200 C fan
First prepare the scrambled tofu ingredients and umami mushrooms.
Tear the oyster mushrooms into strips, clean and chop the scallions or green onions.
For the scramble, drain and dry the tofu, crumble the tofu into a mixing bowl with the tamari, turmeric, garlic powder,nutritional yeast and mix well, set aside
Put a large flat pan heat on high heat, add a little oil, when hot add the mushrooms and cook for 4 – 5 minutes until they reduce and start to nicely brown. In a mug mix together the tamari, maple syrup and smoked paprika and add to the mushrooms and mix well ensuring each mushroom is well coated, remove them from the heat and add to a bowl.
Put the pan back on the heat, add a little oil over medium heat, when hot add the tofu scramble mixture and cook for 2-3 minutes until it starts to brown a little, add a pinch of salt to taste. Remove from the pan into a bowl and sprinkle over some kala namak or sulphur salt and set aside. Give the pan a quick wash and dry.
Heat the pan on medium heat until hot and add 1 tbsp of oil, add the cubed potatoes and cook until they start to brown on each side stirring regularly. Add a generous pinch of salt and add the spicy red pepper pesto/ sriracha and mix well, add in the sliced scallions/ green onions and mix and remove from the pan to a clean bowl.
Mix the mayo and sriracha. Destone the avocado and cut into slices, cover in a little lime or lemon juice if you have it and a sprinkle of salt.
To build our burritos, spread the mayo to cover the burritos leaving a few 2-3 cm around the edge uncovered. Add half the scramble to each tortilla, placing it on the lower third of the tortilla (this will make it easier to roll a good burrito) next directly on top of the scramble add the mushrooms, next some avocado slices and last a quarter of the crispy potatoes on each tortilla (we will serve the remaining crispy potatoes on the side) Add a little more sriracha if you like it spicy.
To roll your burrito fold the short end of the tortilla over the filling and use it to compact the filling with your hands, tuck in both sides and roll the burrito until sealed, repeat with your second burrito. Heat the clean pan over medium heat and add both burritos seam side down, toast for a few minutes on each side until lovely and crispy and brown. Remove from the pan and cut in half and serve with remaining crispy potatoes, slices of avocado and any remaining spicy mayo. Enjoy!
